## Welcome to Jeopardy Trivia!

The purpose of this project was to further familiarize myself with creating web applications utilizing third party databases. It was also a homework assignment for Per Scholas' coding bootcamp.

Api utilized:

http://jservice.io/

jService is an API that has Jeopardy trivia questions and their answers available to the public.

- This API is now defunct.

## How to Play

Generate a random trivia question by clicking the button located at the very top of the screen. Information will be displayed, and you are to guess what / who the info is referring to. Click the button located at the very bottom to reveal the answer! If you guessed correctly, you have the option to click the "Got it" or "Didn't get it" buttons, which will display your updated points earned / loss on the screen. Happy guessing!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Areas of Improvement

1. More CSS! Possible animations / sounds to make the game more visually engaging.
2. Implementation of logic to prevent players from being dishonest with their score.
3. Some of the data displayed is broken. Implementation of a more structured API would be beneficial in the future!
