## Welcome to Jeopardy Trivia! 

The purpose of this project was to further familiarize myself with creating web applications utilizing third party databases. 

## How to Play

Generate a random trivia question by clicking the button located at the very top of the screen. Information will be displayed, and you are to guess what / who the info is referring to. Click the button located at the very bottom to reveal the answer! If you guessed correctly, you have the option to click the "I got it" or "I didn't get it" buttons, which will display your updated points earned / loss on the screen. Happy guessing!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Areas of Improvement 

1. CSS, which I plan on updating before the entire project is complete.
2. Implementation of logic to prevent players from being dishonest with their score.
